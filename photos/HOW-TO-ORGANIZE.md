## 🎯 How It Works

1. **To create a "collection" or "series"**, just move related photos into the same folder
   - *Example:* All American Heart Association photos go in the `american-heart-association` folder

2. **When someone clicks on ANY photo** in that folder, they'll see **ALL related photos** from that same folder in a gallery at the bottom of the lightbox

3. **To add a new category**, just create a new folder in the `photos/` directory
   - Name it something simple like `new-category` (use dashes, no spaces)

4. **The main photos/ folder still works!** Any photos there will show up individually

## ✨ Easy Steps to Organize

### Step 1: Look at a photo and decide what category it belongs to
### Step 2: Drag it into the matching folder  
### Step 3: That's it! The website will automatically group them

> 💡 **Tip:** You can always move photos between folders anytime!
